# Project- PWC-Call-Centre-Solution

## Data Analysis Project: Call Center Performance Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging data analytics to enhance call centre operational efficiency and support data-driven decision-making. As part of the **PwC Virtual Experience Program – “The Call Centre Solution”**, I developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize key performance metrics across customer satisfaction, agent productivity, and service demand trends.

The primary goal is to provide actionable insights that help management identify bottlenecks, improve service quality, and optimize workforce performance.

### Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard visualizations.  
- **Power Query**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning (ETL) from the raw dataset.  
- **Microsoft Excel**: The original dataset source and initial data profiling.

---

### Objective
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in call centre operations. The dashboard enables strategic decision-making by highlighting performance gaps, improving efficiency, and providing visibility into operational health.

---

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Trends in overall satisfaction ratings to understand customer sentiment and loyalty.  
- **Call Handling Metrics**:  
  - Total Calls Answered  
  - Total Calls Abandoned  
  - Call Volume by time and topic  
  - Average Speed of Answer (ASA)  
- **Agent Performance Analysis**:  
  - Performance Quadrant (Calls Answered vs Average Handle Time)  
  - Identification of top and underperforming agents  

---

### Data Insights & Analysis
- **Speed of Answer Trends**: The cumulative speed of answers (in seconds) declined significantly between **March 27, 2021 and March 31, 2021**.  
- **Key Contributors to Decline**: Agents **Dan, Becky, and Greg** showed notable performance drops.  
- **Positive Shifts**: Agents **Diane and Martha** improved their response times.  
- **Satisfaction Ratings Decline**: Customer satisfaction dropped by **82 points** between **March 26 and March 31, 2021**.  
- **Primary Impact Areas**: Technical Support and Admin Support.  
- **Category Volatility**: Payment, Technical Support, and Contract topics showed the highest fluctuations.  

---

### Agent Performance – Speed of Answer Analysis
- Total speed of answers across the call centre: **273,729 seconds**  
- Lowest individual total: **Stewart – 31,570 seconds**  

> Note: While Stewart’s low total suggests efficiency, further evaluation is recommended to ensure service quality is maintained.

---

### Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Targeted Agent Training & Coaching**: Develop improvement plans for underperforming agents and ensure fast agents maintain quality.  
- **Customer Support Optimization**: Review workflows for Technical and Admin Support to reduce friction and improve resolution times.  
- **KPI Monitoring & Continuous Improvement**: Regular dashboard reviews to track progress and implement proactive strategies.

### Broader Business & Financial Implications
- **Cost Management**: Reducing call handling times lowers operational expenses.  
- **Revenue & Profitability**: Higher customer satisfaction improves retention and brand loyalty.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Data-driven insights support smarter staffing, training, and technology investment decisions.
